## Solutions for the cryptopals challenge, now in golang

Working through the [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) problem sets once again, this time to teach myself Go. Progress is already much better this time around!

I am also using tests this time, which has already proven extremely useful on several occasions where the code had to be edited to change parameter types and such.

I don't have a good idea of how to implement a `main` function yet so the one that's there just prints the command you should use to run the tests.

In order to run the tests and see how things are for yourself, run `go test ./...` in the directory of your choice!
